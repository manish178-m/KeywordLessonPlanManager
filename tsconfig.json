        "target": "es2015", // This is the module system to target, es2015 is compatible with most modern browsers. You can use es2017 and use keywords like async/await, but not many browsers support that yet.

        "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true, // This allows you to use "export default class MyClass ..." and "import MyClass from ..." rather than "export class MyClass ..." and "import { MyClass } from ...". Personally I don't like this as it leads to intellisense issues, but many libraries use it so you should enable it.
